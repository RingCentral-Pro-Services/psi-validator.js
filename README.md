# About
Insanely simple page for showing off validators. 

## Coding
Under `/src/components/` you'll find a base component for showing off emails. 

You can basically copy paste that, and change some variable names around, and the imported class name from the
Validator repo.

Make sure to import your newly created components into `App.js` and actually add it to the list of displayed components.

## Deploying
To deploy, simple run `npm run deploy` in terminal, and GitHub takes care of the rest!
